== Description ==

This theme is designed to work with the GeoDirectory plugin, and it's addons. To function correctly you will also need the Genesis Compatibility Plugin.

If you do not wish to use the option in GeoDirectory to set GeoDirectory as your homepage, there are separate widgets provided which you can use to create an alternate homepage layout. If you leave these widgets empty, you will get a standard blog page for your homepage.

There is a separate Green colour scheme included which you will find in the Genesis options, and in the WordPress customizer.

This theme includes 6 layout options, although you should avoid setting Fullwidth as your default.
